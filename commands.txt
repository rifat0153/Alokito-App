# Force pushing more safely with --force-with-lease

Force pushing with a "lease" allows the force push to fail if there are new commits on the remote that you didn't expect (technically,
 if you haven't fetched them into your remote-tracking branch yet), 
which is useful if you don't want to accidentally overwrite someone else's commits that you didn't even know about yet, 
 and you just want to overwrite your own:

git push <remote> <branch> --force-with-lease


## new remote add

echo "# q" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/rifat0153/q.git
git push -u origin main
