# Force pushing more safely with --force-with-lease

Force pushing with a "lease" allows the force push to fail if there are new commits on the remote that you didn't expect (technically,
 if you haven't fetched them into your remote-tracking branch yet), 
which is useful if you don't want to accidentally overwrite someone else's commits that you didn't even know about yet, 
 and you just want to overwrite your own:

git push <remote> <branch> --force-with-lease
